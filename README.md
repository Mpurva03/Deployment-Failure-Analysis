# Deployment Failure Analysis

## **Overview**
Deployment failure analysis involves diagnosing and resolving issues that prevent successful deployment by examining logs, configurations, and environments. Visualization aids this process by using charts, flow diagrams, and heat maps to represent errors, dependencies, and trends, making it easier to identify root causes and improve future deployments.

## **Technology**
+ Python
+ Power BI for Visualization
+ MySql
+ MsExcel

## **Features**
+ Error Logging: Captures and records error messages and stack traces during deployment.
+ Visualizations: Uses charts, flow diagrams, and heat maps to represent error patterns and system states.
+ Trend Analysis: Analyzes historical data to identify recurring issues or patterns.
